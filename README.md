# FunRace

## The time it took you to perform the exercise

It took me about 4:30 hours to finish the main gameplay loop

## The parts that were difficult for you and why

The most difficult part for me was remembering how curves work and making them simple enough to follow and to evaluate.

## The parts you think you could do better and how

The code for the catmull-rom spline could be much better, in fact I'm sure there are other much better alternatives to this kind of curve, but I needed to make something simple so that the circuit could be created easily. I could do bezier curves that on the long run would be better to create circuits. Also the graphic quality of the game isn't very good, but it wasn't super essential to the game loop. It could be improved with literally anything else that isn't cubes or capsules.

## What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

Create more kinds obstacles, things like jumping for example. There could also be power ups that make you go faster. Of course, an AI to race against would be nice.

## What did you think

Overall it was nice, I think 5 hours is a bit limiting but I understand why you put this kind of time limit. I feel that if I had a couple of days I could do a much better game.
